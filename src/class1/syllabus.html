      <h4>Academic Disability Accommodations</h4>
      <p>
        MICA makes reasonable academic accommodations for qualified students
        with disabilities. All academic accommodations must be approved through
        the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Students requesting accommodation
        should schedule an appointment at the LRC (410-225-2416 or e-mail
        LRC@mica.edu), located in Bunting 110. It is the student’s
        responsibility to make an accommodation request in a timely manner.
        Academic accommodations are not retroactive.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)</h4>
      <p>
        Students are responsible to follow health and safety guidelines relevant
        to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA's
        Emergency Operations Plan and attend EHS training. Students are required
        to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major or
        class. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection
        equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and
        personal protection are in place.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Plagiarism</h4>
      <p>
        Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for
        students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of
        others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to
        become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in
        developing original work.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Policy</h4>
      <p>
        MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming
        authorship of, or using someone else's ideas or work without proper
        acknowledgement. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate
        another's work, paraphrase another's ideas, or appropriate images in a
        manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the
        student's department. In addition, students may not submit the same work
        for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all
        of the instructors of the courses involved.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Consequenses</h4>
      <p>
        When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work
        submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student
        and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of
        a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the
        instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or
        program director. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the
        department chair or program director may then report the student to the
        appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties,
        including expulsion.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Appeal Process</h4>
      <p>
        Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing
        plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue.
        Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a
        letter of appeal to the department chairperson or program director, or
        relevant dean or provost related to the course for which actions were
        taken. The academic officer will assign three members of the relevant
        department/division to serve on a review panel. The panel will meet with
        the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant
        and available materials. The panel will determine whether or not to
        confirm the charge and penalties. The findings of the panel are final.
        The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, division, the
        student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any
        recommendations for change in penalties.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Title IX Notification</h4>
      <p>
        Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an educational
        environment based on mutual respect that is free from discrimination and
        harassment. There are multiple ways to report sexual
        harassment/misconduct/assault and reports are encouraged
        (www.mica.edu/equal_opportunity (Links to an external site.)). Students
        requiring academic adjustments due to an incident involving sexual
        harassment or discrimination should contact Student Affairs at
        410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363. Keeping with
        institutional commitments to equity and to comply with Title IX of the
        Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil
        Rights, faculty and staff members are required to report disclosures of
        gender based discrimination made to them by students. However, nothing
        in this policy shall abridge academic freedom or MICA’s educational
        mission. Prohibitions against discrimination and discriminatory
        harassment do not extend to actions, statements or written materials
        that are relevant and appropriately related to course subject matter or
        academic discussion.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Students with Extended Illness or Absence</h4>
      <p>
        In the case of extended illness or other absences that may keep the
        student from attending a class for more than three meetings,
        undergraduate students must contact the Student Development Specialist
        in the Division of Student Affairs or have an official disability
        accommodation letter issued by the Learning Resource Center that
        specifically addresses class absences. For students who have not been
        approved for academic disability accommodations, the Student Development
        Specialist will work with the student to determine the cause and
        appropriateness of the absences and subsequently notify instructors as
        necessary. Graduate students must contact the instructor, program
        director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in professional
        studies programs must contact the Associate Dean for Open Studies. The
        appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with relevant
        faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory
        academic progress, which is ultimately at the sole discretion of the
        faculty member.
